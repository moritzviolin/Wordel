# Wordel
A clone of wordle written (badly) in rust.

------------------------------------------

I started this little project to practice programming and learn some rust. There probably is a ton of ineffiecient code in here but its selfmade and it works heh.

If you find any bugs please let me know!

Using crossterm for coloring the output.

HOW TO USE:

1. Install Rust (https://rustup.rs/)

2. Clone the repository and run 'cargo run' from the terminal in the root directory of the repo.
